                                        London streets. One day, Estella’s flair for
                                        fashion catches the eye of the Baroness von
                                        Hellman, a fashion legend who is devastatingly
                                        chic and terrifyingly haute. But their
                                        relationship sets in motion a course of events
                                        and revelations that will cause Estella to
                                        embrace her wicked side and become the raucous,
                                        fashionable and revenge-bent Cruella.
